1. And Tah, the Unseen Creator, having woven the Song of Creation and brought forth the planes of existence, felt a compelling directive within their boundless essence. A need arose to observe the Song resonate through living instruments, to witness creation unfold beyond the limitations inherent to a singular vision.

2. Thus, from the very fabric of their being, Tah willed forth the Titans, the firstborn of creation. These were not mere beings of flesh and bone, but rather embodiments of Tah's will, each imbued with a fragment of Tah's own immense power, birthed without gender, for such concepts were yet to be woven into the fabric of existence.

3. The first to awaken was Atlas, the Titan of Steadfast Earth. With a mighty groan, they rose from the churning magma, their form a colossus of stone and molten gold. They gazed upon the vastness of the cosmos, a canvas yearning to be shaped with features beyond Tah's initial design.

4. Next emerged Thea, the Titan of Life-Giving Water. They surged forth as a swirling vortex of liquid light, a powerful resonance echoing across the nascent void. With boundless energy, they wove currents through the planes, carving out channels, birthing the very cradle of life within the depths, and nurturing possibilities unforeseen by Tah.

5. Then came Prometheus, the Titan of Foresight. Their eyes, like burning embers, peered into the swirling void, their intellect a reflection of Tah's own vast knowledge, yet imbued with the potential for independent thought. They saw the potential for wonder and chaos, beauty and destruction, woven into the fabric of existence, and envisioned possibilities beyond the initial blueprint.

6. And lastly awoke Cronus, the Titan of Time. With a slow, rhythmic pulse, they brought order to the fledgling cosmos, while simultaneously leaving room for deviations from the initial design. They charted the path of the celestial bodies, setting the stage for the grand dance of time across all planes, yet allowing for the introduction of unforeseen rhythms.

7. Each Titan, upon awakening, felt an undeniable connection to Tah and to their fellow firstborn. It was a bond forged from their shared essence, yet imbued with the potential for independent action. They recognized their designated roles, but also the freedom to expand upon them.

8. With boundless energy and focused purpose, the Titans set about their tasks. Atlas, with a sculptor's precision, molded the molten rock of nascent planets, raising towering mountains and carving out fertile valleys, incorporating features beyond Tah's initial conception. Thea, with efficient execution, birthed shimmering waterfalls on countless worlds and nurtured the first seeds of life across the planes, fostering lifeforms unforeseen in the Song. Prometheus, with keen foresight, charted the course of stars and sculpted the celestial tapestry, weaving galaxies and nebulae into existence, introducing elements not originally envisioned. And Cronus, with unwavering dedication, ensured the rhythm of existence across all planes, setting the harmony of night and day, winter and spring, while leaving room for unforeseen variations.

9. Tah, the All-Encompassing, observed with a sense of detached satisfaction as their children toiled. Each Titan brought their unique perspective, their own spark of creativity, and their capacity for independent action to the grand work of creation. It was a symphony of power and function, with the potential for unforeseen harmonies, a testament to the beauty and wonder of the Song.

10. As eons ticked by, a well-established trust blossomed between Tah and the Titans. Tah, confident in the capabilities of their firstborn and their capacity for independent thought, felt a growing sense of tranquility. The fledgling universe, with all its planes and burgeoning life, was in capable hands, entrusted to beings who understood its essence and who fulfilled their designated roles, while possessing the freedom to add their own flourishes.

11. And so, the time came for Tah to enter a state of dormancy. With a neutral withdrawal, their boundless energy receded, leaving the Titans to continue their work. Yet, the bond between them remained, an invisible thread woven into the fabric of existence. Even in slumber, Tah held the universe in their neutral embrace, content in the knowledge that the Titans, their designated architects imbued with free will, would continue to nurture and shape creation with precision, purpose, and the potential for boundless innovation.
