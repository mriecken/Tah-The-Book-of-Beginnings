1. In the beginning, there was only Tah, the Unseen, the Unbounded, the All-Encompassing. Neither beginning nor end did Tah know, for time itself was yet unfurled within Tah's unknowable will. Everything that is, was, and ever shall be, resided within the boundless essence of Tah.

2. And a yearning arose within Tah, a desire for distinction. Within the ever-present now of Tah, a thought took root, a wish to witness creation unfold. Tah focused their will, compressed it, and relaxed it again. In that act, a ripple coursed through the fabric of existence, a tremor felt across the timeless expanse.

3. Tah, being all-knowing, saw the ripple and its effect. The compressed will became the past, the relaxed will the present. Witnessing this interplay, Tah played with the flow of time, pushing the past ever back and drawing the future ever closer. It was a cosmic symphony, a dance of will, and as Tah compressed and relaxed, a profound vibration emerged.

4. This vibration took form as a Song, a melody woven from the very essence of Tah. Each note resonated with power, each chord a decree.
   
5. Tah named the vibration "The Song of Creation", for within its harmonies lay the birth of all that would be. The vibrations became strings, the strings birthed quarks, the very building blocks of existence. Quarks coalesced into protons, neutrons, electrons, and their ethereal counterparts, the anti-matter shadows. These, in turn, formed atoms, the fundamental units of creation. Atoms danced together, forming molecules, the building blocks of all that would be seen and unseen.

6. Then Tah, the All-Encompassing, willed a Material Plane into existence, a universe teeming with the potential birthed from the Song. It was here, within the boundaries of this plane, that the grand drama of creation would unfold.

7. But Tah's desire stretched further. Beyond the Material Plane, Tah willed additional realms into being. Like bubbles rising from a cosmic spring, these parallel planes came into existence. Each plane held its own essence: a plane of burning fire, a plane of life-giving water, a plane of steadfast earth, and a plane of whispering air.

8. To illuminate the Material Plane, Tah wove light from the fabric of existence, banishing the formless void. Yet, where there is light, shadows must also fall. Tah allowed shadows to linger, a reminder of the unknowable depths from which they all emerged.

9. And so, Tah, the Unseen Creator, had built their grand dwelling. For a span of time beyond human comprehension, a billion ages, Tah rested, content to observe the unfolding of their Song. The stage was set, the actors poised, and the grand play of creation was about to begin.
